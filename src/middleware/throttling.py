    Throttling middleware that queues excess requests instead of rejecting them.

    When the limit is reached, new requests WAIT in a queue instead of getting 503'd.
    
    If a request waits longer than `timeout` seconds, it gets a 429 Too Many Requests
    response (which is the correct HTTP status for throttling).
